#  Template custom cmake configuration for compiling
#
#  This file is used to override the build options in build.
#  If you want to change the configuration, please use the following
#  steps. Assume you are on the root directory. First copy the this
#  file so that any local changes will be ignored by git
#
#  $ mkdir build
#  $ cp cmake/config.cmake build
#
#  Next modify the according entries, and then compile by
#
#  $ cd build
#  $ cmake ..
#
#  Then build in parallel with 8 threads
#
#  $ make -j8
